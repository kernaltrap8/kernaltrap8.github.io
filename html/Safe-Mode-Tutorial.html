                First step, is to power off the console, if it is on. Next, hold the power button down until it turns off again. After this is done, hole the button again until you hear two consecutive beeps (e.g. first inital power on beep, then two quick beeps). Release the button, and plug in a DUALSHOCK 3 controller. To update, select Install System Software from the list. Using a USB Flash drive, aquire the choosen firmware from <a href="https://archive.midnightchannel.net/SonyPS/Firmware/?cat=evilnat">here.</a>

                Rename the downloaded file to PS3UPDAT.PUP
            </p>
            <p>
                Once that is done, make a new folder on the USB device on the root named PS3, and a folder inside that named UPDATE. Put the PS3UPDAT.PUP file in the UPDATE folder, and insert the device into the PLAYSTATION3.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, select Install System Software from the choices provided in Safe Mode. Let it scan the device. Once it is done, it should prepare, and then reboot. Once it has rebooted, you should see a screen asking to press the PS BUTTON. Do so, and then follow the on screen instructions.
