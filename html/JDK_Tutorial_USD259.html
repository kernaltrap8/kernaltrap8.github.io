                First, download the x64 Windows compressed archive from this <a href="https://download.oracle.com/java/19/latest/jdk-19_windows-x64_bin.zip">link</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Next, extract the zip in File Explorer or 7zip. Take the JDK folder that contains the bin, and conf folders (there should be other folders as well).
            Take the path were the bin folder is located, and copy it using CTRL+C. After you do this, go to the Search bar on the taskbar, and type Control Panel. You need to open up the first option, and then go to User Accounts > User Accounts again > Change my system environment variables. Add a new variable with the variable name JAVA_HOME
            </p>
            <p>
                Give the new variable a value, and put in the path for the JDK (the path you copied earlier). And make sure to save it by clicking OK. As an example, I have JDK on the root of my C drive, so the variable value is "C:/jdk18/" without the quotes.
            </p>

                Thats really all there is to it, however I do recommend using VS Code as the IDE, but NetBeans is the one provided with the course.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I have noticed something when using VS Code and Java. You have to set JDK in the JAVA_HOME var, as well as settings in VS Code. To do this, go to File > Preferences > Settings. Then, search for Java, scroll down to Java Home, and input the path set in the user environment variables. Lets hope this is the last time I have to edit this HTML document.
            </p>

                Speaking of NetBeans, I just thought of something even I had issues with. For some reason, NetBeans wont see the custom USR_VAR we just set, so it had to be defined in a conf. Go to were you have NetBeans installed, for example, it could be in appdata. if it is, type WIN+R on the keyboard, and type appdata in the box that appears. It should open a folder, go inside Local, and look for a NetBeans folder, once inside, go to the etc folder, you should see a couple files, we want the netbeans.conf file. Double click on it, and it should ask what app you want to use. click on "Show more apps" and choose Notepad. Scroll down until you see "#netbeans_jdkhome=" Remove the # and next to the =, type a ", followed by the path that JDK is installed to. Then followed by another ". Then go to File > Save.
