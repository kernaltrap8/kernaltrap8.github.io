            What is CFW?
        </h1>
        <style>
            @font-face {
            font-family: "mata_regular";
            src: url("../font/mata_regular/mata_regular.otf");

            CFW is a lot like Linux, in the way Linux has distros. There are a crap ton of Linux distros, however only some are used. Same goes for PS3.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main CFW most used is REBUG, or EVILNAT. Both are great, and they have differences:
        </p>
        <u1>
            <li>
                REBUG has always had DEX versions
            </li>
            <li>
                EVILNAT has more features, however its less mature than REBUG
            </li>
            <li>
                REBUG has OtherOS, DEX support, but its on older FW versions only, so SEN access can be annoying to get working.
            </li>
        </u1>
        <p>
            EVILNAT (otherwise known as Nathan) has started testing his "PEX/DPEX" CFW. This CFW has more XAI features, as well as DEX. This is the only 4.89 DEX CFW, ever since the last DEX OFW release, 4.84
        </p>
        <p>
            When 4.89.3 releases, I will put a download link here.

            Differences between CFW and PS3HEN
        </p>
        <u1>
            <li>
                PS3HEN uses HFW, but PS3HEN must be installed after HFW
            </li>
            <li>
                CFW doesnt have this problem. For the first install, just patch the console, then install CFW.
            </li>
            <li>
                PS3HEN must be enabled after every reboot (wether it be a LV2 reboot, or hardware reboot)
            </li>
            <li>
                CFW uses either COBRA or MAMBA (MAMBA is a different version of COBRA, its essentially the same but PS3HEN uses it for base as its more up to date)
            </li>
            <li>
                CFW is more stable and works with more homebrews.
            </li>
        </u1>
