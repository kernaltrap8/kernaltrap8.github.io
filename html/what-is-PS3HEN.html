            PS3HEN is the alternative jailbreak for PS3's that either

            <li>
                Has 3.56 or higher minver
            </li>
            <li>
                The user chooses not to use CFW
            </li>
            <li>
                BG TOOLSET is not accessible. (this is the main case for now)
            </li>
        </u1>
        <p>
            PS3HEN utilizes a very basic version of COBRA, inside a SPRX that is loaded when you click on "Enable HEN". I myself don't know much about PS3HEN, so take a look at the
                <a class="link1" href="https://github.com/PS3Xploit/PS3HEN">Github page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            PS3HEN is installed via the web-browser, it utilizes Webkit and XML exploits. The original installer took advantage ove a p3t (theme) exploit, however this is less reliable than the newer (Webkit based) exploit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though PS3HEN is derived from COBRA, it must be enabled after boot, since we don't have LV1 access during boot to hook it into LV2 kernel. CFW works this way because of the NoFSM patch you install with BG TOOLSET.
