                For a majority of my life, I have spent it around computers. Now, that I am in my late teen years fastly aproaching adulthood, I have surrounded myself in various computerized devices and electroics. I am primarily a software developer, however I dabble in computer science concepts such as reverse engineering and low level programming with Assembly.

                As a child, I had a wide imagination and a passion to learn. Throughout my school years, I would flourish and surpass my peers. Until my teen years, at least.

                Throughout my teen years, it was pretty rough. Starting middle school was hard, and I was constantly bullied and harrased. This resulted in me getting angered at people, and then getting in trouble with school staff. This was a endless cycle up until COVID hit and I now go to a hybrid school, where I dont have to go in person as much as a public, brick and morder type of school.

            <p>
                Now that I am in high school, I have matured a great deal and have learned a lot throughout the years. I am currently a self-taugh software engineer, as well as reverse engineer. I program in C, however I also know HTML and CSS. I am also currently learning x86_64 assembly.
